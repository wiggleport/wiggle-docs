Modeling Strategy

At it's very core, Wiggleport is based on a way of interacting with hardware by *modeling* the way data flows. These models contain anything the computer needs to know about some hardware in order to communicate with it, including how to configure any programmable parts of that hardware. Wiggleport's modularity comes from the way these models can be freely reassembled without rewriting driver software.
