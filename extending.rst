====================
Extending Wiggleport
====================

Wiggleport wants to make it easier for you to create things we've never thought of, without reinventing all the wheels.


Module Pinout
=============

The Wiggle Spine has 7 connectors that each supply power and data to one module.


Using Programmable Logic
========================

Link to some Verilog resources for convenience, and talk about the role of custom programmable logic in creating a Wiggleport module.


JSON Packages
=============

When you design a new module for Wiggleport, you supply additional JSON files that load into the hardware model when your add-on is detected.
